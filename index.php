				<h2>Whales of the World</h2>
					<p class="dark">Whales are a diverse group of marine mammals that inhabit oceans worldwide. 
					Despite living in the water, whales breathe air. They feed, mate and give birth at sea. 
					They communicate with a complex set of mysterious sounds. 
					There are two types of whales: baleen and toothed. Baleen whales have special
					bristle-like structures in their mouths that help strain food from the water. Toothed whales
					have teeth. Whales covered on this site, range in size from 18 feet to 105 feet in length. 
					The larger whales are generally baleen whales and the smaller are of the toothed variety. Baleen whales
					have two blowholes while toothed whales only have one.</p>
					<h3>Conservancy Efforts</h3>
					<p class="dark">Unfortunately, many whales are reaching the status of threatened or endangered 
					due to human activity. In the past century, many of the large whale species were hunted to the brink of 
					extinction by commercial whaling though some of those species are now recovering and the hunts are banned
					in many areas of the world.</p>
